<h2 align="center">About me</h2>

###

After building a solid career in Business Administration (Finance), I decided to completely change direction and follow my true passion: technology. In 2025, I made a significant change, moving to Portugal and starting my journey at 42 School Porto.

With a lot of effort and dedication, I successfully completed the Piscine, the immersion phase at 42, and Iâ€™m now officially part of this amazing community of learners and developers. ðŸš€

ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m studying the C language, which is the initial phase at 42, and Iâ€™m excited to explore more about this world of software development.

ðŸ”¨ Although Iâ€™m just starting in the tech field, my previous experience in finance gives me an analytical and strategic mindset, which Iâ€™m applying to learn and grow.

ðŸ“« How to reach me?
